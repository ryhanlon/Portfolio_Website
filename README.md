# Rebecca's Portfolio Website
##### Project for the *Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree*

#### Intro


Title: Rebecca's Portfolio Website

This website is built to feature projects that I have developed.  It showcases each project with a brief interduction and a direct link to  GitHub for further details.

##### Technical Components
- CSS Grid, Flexbox and Media Queries are used to build the _responsive features_
- `scrset` html attribute is used for image optimizations
- JavaScript (ECMASript 6) is used for user interactions: clicking menu for the _project drawer_ to slide out, animating the _menu hamburger_ to show open and closed status
- Semantic HTML, Aria-roles attributes, Aria-labels and alt tags for images are used for an enhanced Screen Reader experience
- Code snippet for menu drawer from the Lesson 14: Common Responsive Patterns Module
- Code snippet for an animated hamburger icon from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_menu_icon.asp)
